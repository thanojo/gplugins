class DesignRecipe:
    """
    A DesignRecipe represents a flow of operations on GDSFactory components,
    with zero or more dependencies. Note that dependencies are assumed to be independent,
    dependent dependencies should be nested. When `eval()`ed, A DesignRecipe `eval()`s
    its dependencies if they they've become stale,
    and optionally executes some tool-specific functionality.
    For example,an FdtdDesignRecipe might simulate its `component` in
    Lumerial FDTD to extract its s-parameters.


    Attributes:
        dependencies: This `DesignRecipe`s dependencies. These are assumed to be independent
        last_hash: The hash of the system last time eval() was executed. This is used to determine whether the recipe's
                    configuration has changed, meaning it must be re-eval'ed.
        cell: GDSFactory layout cell or component. This is not necessarily the same `component` referred to in the
                `dependencies` recipes.
        layer_stack: PDK layerstack
        dirpath: Root directory where recipes runs are stored
        recipe_dirpath: Recipe directory where recipe results are stored. This is only created upon eval of the recipe.
        run_convergence: Run convergence if True. Accurate simulations come from simulations that have run convergence.
        override_recipe: Overrides recipe results if True. This runs the design recipe regardless if results are
                        available and overwrites recipe results.
